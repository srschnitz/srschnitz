## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  My Landing Page is Sitting here.  Link to Landing Page:  https://gamma.app/docs/Susan-Schnitzel--kqcz4cxu6dmvunf?mode=doc
The Landing page includes all the projects/Portfolio I am working on.  
These make it easier to look at the real portfolios, not flattened by pdf conversions.  
I also have only a few examples of Powerbi visuals.  I do have other PowerBi pdfs under each different project.  Sorry, I didn't upload my Powerbi files, but I have a long story of why......not fun!  
Enjoy and I welcome any comments, suggestions or shares.  

I am working on all my REPOs, to update my  READMEs.  It has been recommended to me to get to the point on the front end and let people decide if they want to do a deep dive into the material.
