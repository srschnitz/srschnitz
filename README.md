## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  My Landing Page is Sitting here.  
Link to Landing Page:  https://gamma.app/docs/Susan-Schnitzel--kqcz4cxu6dmvunf?mode=doc
The Landing page includes all the projects/Portfolio for the different Repos I have.  
There are three different ones for my Steel project; Full and long version, Condensed Version and ML add-on.   
I like the look of my portfolios better than the flattened pdfs.  There are some details that get lost when converted to a pdf. 
With each portfolios, I admit that played around with the gammaapp capibiliies- some of my graphis/backgrounds are a little over the top, but I thought was fun.
I have only a few examples of Powerbi visuals.  
I do have other PowerBi pdfs under each different project. I have not uploaded my actual Powerbi files to the Repos yet or unsure I will.

**I am currently working on all my REPOs, to update my  READMEs.  It has been recommended to me to get to the point on the front end and let people decide if they want to do a deep dive into the material. **
